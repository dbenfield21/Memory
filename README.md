## Getting Started
### **Description & Background**
Obliviate is a memory card matching game. Players chose one card by clicking and then a second to determine if they are matches (based on the cards image). If the two cards are matches they remain face up, otherwise both cards flip back to their original state, face down. Players must remeber the location of the cards that have not been flipped, in order to chose the correct matches. Once all matches have been made (6) the game is won.

I loved to play memory games as a kid. Obliviate is Harry Potter themed because of my love for Harry Potter and its asthetic. 

Some of the features I chose: 

- Each of the card images relates to a critical theme/character/ or reference to Harry Potter. 

- Obliviate is a spell in Harry Potter to remove memories, hence the games name. 

- Alohomora, the games reset button, is spell to unlock. When you click Alohomora it unlocks a new game.
