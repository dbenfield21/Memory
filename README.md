## Description & Background 
Obliviate is a memory card matching game. Players chose one card by clicking and then a second to determine if they are matches (based on the cards image). If the two cards are matches they remain face up, otherwise both cards flip back to their original face down state. Players must remeber the location of the cards that have not been flipped in order to chose the correct matches. Once all matches have been made (6) the game is won.

Obliviate is Harry Potter themed because of my love for Harry Potter and its asthetic. Some of the features I chose: 

  -Each of the card images relates to a critical theme/character/ or reference to Harry Potter. 

  -Obliviate is a spell in Harry Potter to remove memories, hence the games name. 

  -Alohomora, the games reset button, is spell to unlock. When you click Alohomora it unlocks a new game.

**[Obliviate](https://unit1-memorygame-darby.surge.sh/) can be played here. It functions just like any other matching card game you may have played.**

## Next Steps

 Planned future enhancements that I would like to make:
  
 
- Peek at the board button to show card layout before the game begins
- Improved CSS styling
- Add additional messages such as when a match is made,"match made" and when two cards are not matches, "try again"
- Add animations to buttons and messages 
- Add sounds 
- Add additional cards
- Add timer for the game
